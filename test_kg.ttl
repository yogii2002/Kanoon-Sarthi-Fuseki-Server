It may also be noted here that PW-3 did not support the prosecution case and he was treated hostile. (iii)PW-2, Kamla, Chowkidar of the village, stated that when PW-1 and his brothers were coming to village Haider, he met them on the way and told them that the appellant had killed the deceased and they need not go further and should return and go to police station to lodge the complaint. PW-2 has stated that he was told by PW-9 Ghuman Singh about the appellant killing the deceased but PW-9 Ghuman Singh does not support the case of the prosecution and the statement of PW-2. He too was treated as hostile. (iv) The axe alleged to have been used in the commission of offence, said to have been recovered at the instance of the appellant, was not produced before the Court and there was no occasion for the doctor to confirm whether injuries of the nature found on the deceased could be caused by such an axe.
